 9. Design a program that reads an integer positive number greater than 0 and says if
it’s a “perfect number”. A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of all its divisors.
The messages are the following:
“Enter an integer positive number greater than 0:”
“The number is not valid, try again.”
“The number is perfect.”
“The number is not perfect.”
