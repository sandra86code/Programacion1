 7. Design a program that asks how many numbers the user wants to write. After the
user enters all numbers, the program should say the medium of the numbers. If the
user inputs a wrong number, the program should ask for it again. The messages are
the following:
“How many numbers do you want input?” to ask for the number of numbers.
“Enter one number greater than 0:” to ask for a number.
“The number is not valid, it should be greater than 0” to inform that the number is not
valid.
“The medium is XX.XX” to show the result.
